Python Introduction:
-- Python was created by Guido Van Rossum in 1991 and further deeveloped by the Python Software Foundation.
-- It was designed with focus on code readibility and its syntax allows up to express concept in fewer lines of code.

Key Features of Python:-
   -- Python’s simple and readable syntax makes it beginner-friendly.
   -- Python runs seamlessly on Windows, macOS and Linux.
   -- Includes libraries for tasks like web development, data analysis and machine learning.
   -- Variable types are determined automatically at runtime, simplifying code writing.
   -- Supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, 
      functional and procedural programming.
   -- Python is free to use, distribute and modify.
How does this work:

   -- print() is a built-in Python function that tells the computer to show something on the screen.
   -- The message "Hello, World!" is a string, which means it's just text. In Python, strings are always written inside             quotes (either single ' or double ").
   -- Anything after # in a line is a comment. Python ignores comments when running the code, but they help people                  understand what the code is doing.
   -- Comments are helpful for explaining code, making notes or skipping lines while testing.

Indentation in Python

   In Python, Indentation is used to define blocks of code. It tells the Python interpreter that a group of statements belongs to a specific block. All statements with the same level of indentation are considered       part of the same block. Indentation is achieved using whitespace (spaces      or tabs) at the beginning of each line. The most common convention is to      use 4 spaces or a tab, per level of indentation.

Example:

      print("I have no indentation")
​
       print("I have tab indentaion")

Explanation:-
   -- first print statement has no indentation, so it is correctly executed.
   -- second print statement has tab indentation, but it doesn't belong to a new block of code. Python expects the indentation level to be consistent within the same block. This inconsistency causes an IndentationError.
